# Save Your Time

In a world where time is everything, a powerful clock at the center of the universe is the only source of time and energy. However, an evil sorcerer has cast a spell that is slowing down time and sent his minions to destroy the clock.

As the controller of the clock, you are the last line of defense against an invasion of time-wasting monsters that threaten to plunge the world into chaos. With your quick reflexes and precise aiming, you fire powerful projectiles from the clock's hands to defeat the monsters that are approaching from all directions.

As you progress through the game, you will encounter more challenging monsters that require different strategies to defeat. You'll need to carefully choose which type of projectile to use and when to fire to maximize your effectiveness and save your time.

Will you be able to save the clock and restore time to its rightful pace? The fate of the world depends on your skills and bravery. Enter the world of "Save Your Time!" and find out!

## How to Play

### How to Survive

In this game, you play as a clock and enemies will come at you from all directions. Your objective is to shoot them down to stay alive. Your remaining time is displayed above, and if it runs out, you lose the game.

### Shooting

To shoot enemies, you can click on the screen or press the <kbd>SPACE</kbd> key. The projectiles will come out from each hand of the clock.

### Aiming

You can aim by adjusting the time on the sidebar. Alternatively, you can use the keyboard to adjust the time. If you look at your numpad, you can imagine the <kbd>4</kbd>, <kbd>5</kbd>, <kbd>6</kbd>, <kbd>1</kbd>, <kbd>2</kbd>, <kbd>3</kbd> keys to be aligned with the arrows on the sidebar. To use this shortcut, you must have the numlock on.

### Rewards

Shooting down enemies will earn you rewarded time. Each enemy holds a different value of reward. The closer the enemy gets to you, the lower the reward will be.
