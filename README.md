# Save Your Time

In a world where time is everything, a powerful clock at the center of the universe is the only source of time and energy. However, an evil sorcerer has cast a spell that is slowing down time and sent his minions to destroy the clock.

As the controller of the clock, you are the last line of defense against an invasion of time-wasting monsters that threaten to plunge the world into chaos. With your quick reflexes and precise aiming, you fire powerful projectiles from the clock's hands to defeat the monsters that are approaching from all directions.

The clock can fire three types of projectiles: second, minute, and hour. Each projectile has different properties that make them more effective against certain types of monsters. For example, second projectiles are quick and accurate, making them ideal for fast-moving monsters like Procrastination. Minute projectiles are slower but more powerful, making them great for taking out larger monsters like Laziness. Hour projectiles are the most powerful but also the slowest, making them ideal for taking out tough monsters like Distraction.

As you progress through the game, you will encounter more challenging monsters that require different strategies to defeat. You'll need to carefully choose which type of projectile to use and when to fire to maximize your effectiveness and save your time.

Will you be able to save the clock and restore time to its rightful pace? The fate of the world depends on your skills and bravery. Enter the world of "Save Your Time!" and find out!
