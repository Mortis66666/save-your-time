# Save Your Time

This game is made for the [Gamedev.js Jam 2023](https://itch.io/jam/gamedevjs-2023)

## Intro

In a world where time is everything, a powerful clock at the center of the universe is the only source of time. However, an army of greedy monsters want to steal time from the clock.

As the controller of the clock, you are the last line of defense against an never-ending invasion of time-wasting monsters that threaten to steal time and create chaos in the universe. With your quick reflexes and precise aiming, you fire powerful time vortexes from the clock's hands to defeat the monsters that are approaching from all directions.

As you progress through the game, you will encounter more challenging monsters that require different strategies to defeat. You'll need to carefully choose which powerups to use and when to fire to maximize your effectiveness and save your time.

Will you be able to save the clock from endless wave of monsters? The fate of the world depends on your skills and bravery. Enter the world of "Save Your Time!" and find out!

## How to Play

### How to Survive

In this game, you control a clock and monsters will come at you from all directions. Your objective is to stay alive by shooting them. A timer will be displayed and it will decrease second by second, and if it runs out, you lose the game. The only way to lengthen the timer is to kill monsters.

### Shooting

To shoot enemies, you can click on the screen or press the <kbd>SPACE</kbd> key. The projectiles will come out from each hand of the clock.

### Aiming

You can aim by adjusting the time on the sidebar. Alternatively, you can use the keyboard to adjust the time. If you look at your numpad, you can imagine the <kbd>4</kbd>, <kbd>5</kbd>, <kbd>6</kbd>, <kbd>1</kbd>, <kbd>2</kbd>, <kbd>3</kbd> keys to be aligned with the arrows on the sidebar. To use this shortcut, you must have the num lock on. <kbd>Q</kbd>, <kbd>A</kbd>, <kbd>W</kbd>, <kbd>S</kbd>, <kbd>E</kbd>, <kbd>D</kbd> keys are also an option and they are aligned with the arrows on the sidebar.
